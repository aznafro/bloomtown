# Bloomtown

After having mostly completed Udemy's Web Developer Course by Colt Steele, I decided to try and make a functional website with features like registering, making posts and comments, and viewing items for sale that are populated from a database.

Bloomtown is that website. It is using the MEN stack and I also decided to use Bootstrap.

You can see the live site [here](https://bloomtown.herokuapp.com/).
